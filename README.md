# Simulation-of-CPU
#Simulation method: use a loop to simulate the CPU clock interrupt, generate an interrupt every second. Each second, 
#tasks are selected according to different CPU scheduling algorithms and IO simulations are executed simultaneously, 
#and task execution status is determined. 
#CPU scheduling algorithms schedule tasks according to different scheduling algorithms and load tasks into memory.
